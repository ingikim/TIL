# Purity (Part 1)

In functional programming, we strive to use “pure” functions as much as possible. There are two qualities that make a function “pure”:

The function depends only on the input provided to it to produce a result (and not on any external state).
The function does not cause any observable side effects, such as modifying a global object or modifying a parameter passed by reference.
